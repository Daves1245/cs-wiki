# Computer Science Wiki

## General Introduction

In order to get started learning computing, you'll want a primer on the computational model used by Linux. So first take a look at `linux-basics.md`

## Algorithms

Here is a collection of wiki entries regarding Algorithms of all types:

| Wiki Entry    | Usage Case    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `hashmaps.md`   | NOTE: TODO |
| `heaps.md`   | NOTE: TODO |
| `bbst.md`   | NOTE: TODO |

## Creating and Hosting a website

Here is a collection of the wiki entries that will help one learn how to create and host their own website:

| Wiki Entry    | Usage Case    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `apache.md`   | Used for learning how to host static HTML/CSS/JS files. (NOTE: Deprecated in favor of NodeJS and other modern backends with built-in static file support) |
| `nodejs.md`    | NOTE: TODO (Used for learning how to setup a NodeJS backend, with static file serving and optional Typescript) |
| `mysql.md`    | Learning how to setup a MySQL instance, and send commands to create and modify the MySQL database  |

## Systems-level computer science

For learning how a computer works on a CPU-instruction-by-CPU-instruction hardware-level basis, you can use the following wiki entries:

| Wiki Entry    | Usage Case    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `operating-systems.md`   | NOTE: TODO |
| `filesystems.md`    | NOTE: TODO |
| `optimizing-compilers.md`   | Will explain how a compiler can take your C code, and optimize it to go 3-10x faster than what those lines of C directly translate to in assembly |
